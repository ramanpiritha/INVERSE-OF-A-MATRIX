# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
 ## Algorithm:
 ```
Step1 :
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation.
Step 2:
Type the program to be executed.
Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.inv(), we can find the solutions.
Step 4:
Print the value and end the program.
```
## Program:

#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: PIRITHARAMAN R
#RegisterNumber:23013537
```
import numpy as np
A=[[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]]
b=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(b)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
